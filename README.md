# Car Dashboard with SOME/IP Integration

## Overview

This project implements a car dashboard system that communicates with various services using the SOME/IP (Scalable Service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP) protocol. The dashboard acts as a client, interacting with services such as speed, fuel level, and temperature etc.

## Features

- **Speed Display:** Real-time display of the vehicle's speed obtained from the speed service.
- **Fuel Level Indicator:** Visual representation of the current fuel level retrieved from the fuel service.
- **Temperature Gauge:** Display of the engine temperature obtained from the temperature service.
- **SOME/IP Integration:** Utilizes the SOME/IP protocol for communication with various vehicle services.

## Requirements

- **Hardware:** The dashboard system should be compatible with the vehicle's network architecture and capable of connecting to the SOME/IP network.
- **Software:** Ensure that the necessary libraries and dependencies for SOME/IP communication are installed on the dashboard system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd car-dashboard
   # Instructions for installing required dependencies (if any)
   ```

3. Build and deploy the dashboard software to the target hardware.

## Configuration

- **Service Configuration:** Modify the configuration files to specify the IP addresses, ports, and other settings required to connect to the various services.
- **Dashboard Layout:** Customize the dashboard layout and design according to the vehicle's requirements and user preferences.

## Usage

1. Power on the dashboard system.
2. Ensure that the vehicle's network is operational and the services are running.
3. The dashboard should automatically connect to the services and display the relevant information.
4. Monitor the speed, fuel level, and temperature readings while driving.
